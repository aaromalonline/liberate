# **Liberate**  
### *Freedom Beyond Barriers*  

**Liberate** is a muscle movement detection system that converts subtle muscle activity into control signals. By detecting slight facial or body muscle movements, the system enables users to control devices like a **computer cursor, wheelchair, or keyboard**. This innovation offers an intuitive, hands-free interface, enhancing accessibility and communication for individuals with limited mobility.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects subtle muscle movements (facial/body)
- Converts movement signals into control actions
- Hands-free interaction for enhanced accessibility
- Can control a **computer cursor, wheelchair, or keyboard**
- Affordable and minimalistic design

### 👀 Modes of operation & Features of Ver1.0 (Comming soon..)
- Keyboard interface & control using muscle twitches
- specific command control having dedicated operations 
- Speech synthesizer to vocalize the text message generated using a TTS engine

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** for signal processing & control logic
- **Arduino** for sensor data acquisition (I2C Interface)
- **Accelerometer/Tap Sensor** for muscle movement detection
- **Serial Communication** for real-time data transfer
